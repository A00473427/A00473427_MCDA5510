## About Me

My name is Deepakk Vignesh Jayamohan. My A# is A00473427. I'm from Chennai,India. I completed my four-year bachelor's degree back in 2020. After that I worked as a Software Developer for 3 years specializing in frontend before joining SMU.

## Common Topic

The common topic that bought us together is our love for the sport of cricket. In countries like India and Pakistan cricket is a like a religion. The Google defines cricket as a game played with a ball and bat by two sides of usually 11 players each on a large field centering upon two wickets each defended by a batsman. But, there is more to it. The definition misses the memories, the emotions, and the pride when our respective national teams step into the field. And those factors mixed with our blood is what made us the person we are, and we will be.

## My team members

The following are the team members that share a common interest with me.

-> Umair Habib - Umair is from Pakistan. he too has worked as a software developer before specializing in backend. His favorite cricketer is Shahid Afridi.

-> Noman Shafi - Noman is from Pakistan. Like the rest of us Noman has worked as a software developer too with only difference being that he is a full-stack developer. His favorite cricketer is Shoaib aktar.
